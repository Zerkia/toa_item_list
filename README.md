# Raids Item List (Tombs of Amascut)

## The idea of this project is to be able to compete between 2 teams to see who can get all the items first. The project makes use of localStorage to select a team, and then a name and an image link as proof of aquiring the item.

## This project is made in React.js and Material UI, and makes use of a small database to store the item data for each collected item.
